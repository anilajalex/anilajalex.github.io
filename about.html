		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<p>I've always been committed to telling a story. As a journalist, I primarily used words to convey stories. But at my tenure at Politico, I realized that words aren't always the right medium to tell a story. I really wanted to explore different ways to represent a story, whether it be through data visualization, design, or building an app. This is ultimately what lead me to General Assembly: I wanted to learn how to help businesses tell their stories to customers. </p>
